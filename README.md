# parse
An FFXI Parser Addon for Windower. This addon parses both offensive and defensive data, stores WS/JAs/spells data by individual spell, tracks additional information like multihit rates, and provides the ability to export/import data in XML format.

### Commands

`//parse pause`
Pauses the parser.

`//parse reset`
Resets the currently stored data.

`//parse report [stat] [chatmode]`
Reports stat to party. If [stat] not provided, will report damage. If [chatmode] not provided, will print to personal chatlog. Valid stats include, but aren't limited to:
* damage (% reported is player's portion of total damage)
* melee | ranged (% reported is hit rate)
* crit | r_crit
* multi (reports percent and cardinality of double attacks, triple attacks, etc., but does not distinguish between OAX)
* block | parry | evade (% reported is based on action hierarchy; for example, block % excludes evades and parry % excludes both evades and non-engaged hits taken)
* ws | ja | spell (reports averages for total category, and each individual spell)

Valid chatmodes include:
* p: party
* s: say
* l: linkshell
* l2: linkshell2
* t [player name]: tell

`//parse show melee|ranged|magic|defense`
Toggles visibility of each display box. Note that while data is still parsed regardless of visibility, these displays are not updated unless visible, saving resources.

`//parse interval [number]`
Changes the interval rate at which the display boxes are updated. Default is '3', meaning the box will update once for every three recorded action packets.

`//parse filter add|remove|clear`
Filters data by monster name according to substrings.

`//parse list mobs|players`
Lists mobs and players that are indexed in database.

`//parse rename [player/monster name] [new name]`
Renames a player or monster to a new name for all future, incoming data.

`//parse export|import [file name]`
Exports/imports XML data to/from the data/export folder. Imported data is merged with any current in-game data.

`//parse save [file name]`
Saves raw data as a tab-delimited file to the data/parse folder. Note that as raw data, it does not output percentages or averages, only total damage (or damage taken), and cardinality. It is recommended to use the export function instead.
